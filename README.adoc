This guide walks you through the process of executing a Spring Batch
job and its partitioned steps on Hadoop YARN. We also add in a way of
simulating an error in a partitioned step to show the restart of a job.

== What you'll build

You'll build a simple Hadoop YARN application with Spring Hadoop and
Spring Boot. This application contains a job with two master steps
where the actual execution is done on YARN as partitioned steps. We also
simulate an error of step execution order to demonstrate a job restart
so that step execution is continued from the failed steps.

== What you'll need

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools.adoc[]
 - Local single-node instance based on Hadoop 2.2.0 or later

NOTE: Testing this sample application doesn't need existing or running Hadoop instance.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/how_to_complete_this_guide.adoc[]

== Set up the project

First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with http://gradle.org[Gradle] is included here. If you're not familiar with it, refer to link:/guides/gs/gradle[Building Java Projects with Gradle].

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/create_directory_structure_yarn_test_hello.adoc[]

=== Create a Gradle build file
Below is the https://github.com/spring-guides/{project_id}/blob/master/initial/build.gradle[initial Gradle build file]. If you are using link:/guides/gs/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)], you can import the guide directly.

`build.gradle`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[]
----

In the above gradle build file we simply create three different jars -- client, appmaster and container, each having classes for its specific role. These jars are then repackaged by Spring Boot's gradle plugin to create executable jars.

You also need a `settings.gradle` file to define the sub-projects.

`settings.gradle`

== Create a Remote Batch Step

First we create an `HdfsTasklet` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/HdfsTasklet.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/HdfsTasklet.java[]
----

- We `@AutoWired` Hadoop's `Configuration` to be able to use
  `FsShell`.
- We simply check if a file exists in HDFS and throw
  `RuntimeException` if the file doesn't exist. This is done to simulate
  error in a `Tasklet`. If the file does exist we simply return `FINISHED`
  from a `Tasklet`.
- To figure out which file name to use, we access stepname which looks
  something like `remoteStep1:partition0` and remove any illegal file name
  characters.

Next we create a `ContainerApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java[]
----

- We simply create two steps named `remoteStep1` and `remoteStep2` and
  attach `HdfsTasklet` to those steps.

Next we create an `application.yml` file for the container app.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

- We disable batch functionality in Spring Boot core to use YARN specific features.
- We add Hadoop configuration for HDFS. This can be customized for accessing a real cluster.
- We enable batch processing on YARN by using
  `spring.yarn.batch.enable` property.

== Create a Batch Job

Now we create a `AppmasterApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java[]
----

- We simply create two master steps named `master1` and `master2`.
  Then we configure those steps to be partitioned on YARN and we set the grid
  size to two.

Next we create a `application.yml` file for appmaster.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

- Again, we disable batch functionality in Boot core to use a YARN specific features.
- We add Hadoop configuration for HDFS. This can be customized for accessing a real cluster.
- We enable batch processing on YARN by using
  `spring.yarn.batch.enable` property.
- We define a job named `job` to run automatically.
- We enable the job named `job` and allow it to do a next operation
  with an indication that job execution should not fail if job
  parameters cannot be incremented.
- We enable job restart and with an indication that job should
  not fail if job cannot be restarted.

== Create a Yarn Client

Now we create a `ClientApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java[]
----

 - {EnableAutoConfiguration}[`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath setting, other beans, and various property settings.
 - Specific auto-configuration for Spring YARN components takes place in the same way it does in a regular Spring Boot app.

The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application. From there, we simply request a bean of type {YarnClient}[`YarnClient`] and execute its `submitApplication()` method. What happens next depends on application configuration, which we go through later in this guide. Did you notice that there wasn't a single line of XML?

Next we create an `application.yml` file for the client.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-client/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-client/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

- Here we simply defined all the files of the application that are needed for submission.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_yarn_application.adoc[]

== Run the Application

Now that you’ve successfully compiled and packaged your application,
it’s time for the fun part of executing it on a Hadoop YARN.

Because we need to persist the Spring Batch job status a database is
needed. We've bundled an instance of `HSQL` which is easy to start
using in-memory mode. In a separate terminal window run the following:
```
$ cd db/
$ unzip hsqldb-2.3.1.zip
$ cd hsqldb-2.3.1/hsqldb/data/
$ java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 mem:testdb --dbname.0 testdb --silent false --trace true
```

Note: If you build this from scratch you can download the HSQL zip file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/files/hsqldb/hsqldb_2_3/[http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/files/hsqldb/hsqldb_2_3/].

Back to setting up for actually running the application. First create two empty files `/tmp/remoteStep1partition0` and `/tmp/remoteStep1partition1`
in HDFS:
```
$ hdfs dfs -touchz /tmp/remoteStep1partition0
$ hdfs dfs -touchz /tmp/remoteStep1partition1
```
Then run the application:
```
$ cd gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist
$ java -jar target/gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist/gs-yarn-batch-restart-client-0.1.0.jar
```
If you check the application status from a YARN resource
manager, you'll see that application FAILED because partitioned steps
of the second phase failed. Now create files `/tmp/remoteStep2partition0`
and `/tmp/remoteStep2partition1`:

```
$ hdfs dfs -touchz /tmp/remoteStep2partition0
$ hdfs dfs -touchz /tmp/remoteStep2partition1
```
Runt the application again:
```
$ java -jar target/dist/gs-yarn-batch-restart-client-0.1.0.jar
```
You should now be able to see that application finished successfully and
the only the failed partitioned steps were executed.

== Test the Application

Below is a class which can be used to execute this application as a
JUnit test without running Hadoop cluster.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist/src/test/java/hello/AppIT.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist/src/test/java/hello/AppIT.java[]
----

Running the JUnit test doesn't require existing database instance
because as seen from a above example, a `HSQL` instance is created
within a test itself.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring YARN application!
